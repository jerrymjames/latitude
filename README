Problem Statement
=================

Write code to generate a CSV file containing first_name, last_name, address, date_of_birth
Load generated CSV in previous step, anonymise data and output of a different file
Columns to anonymise are first_name, last_name and address

Solution
========

Record generation and anonymise functionalities are contained fake_data_generator.py

Step 1: Generate sample data in csv format

Python's Faker module is used to generate  the records. These records will be saved as csv in 
./fake_data/sample_source_data.csv. 

Only 100 records are created. But you can change it by updating 'sample_record_count' variable in start.py 

Step 2 : Anonimise the data generated in step 1

 Read the file ./fake_data/sample_source_data.csv.

 Anonymise first_name and last_name. I have used shuffling method to anonimise these data .
 First_name is shuffled and then last_name is shuffled. This approach will ensure that the full name is completly changes and
 the look and feel of data is not changes. We can use hashing or masking functions also . but I intentionally didnt use them 
 in order to preserve the look and feel of the names

 Anonymise address : The digits in address are replaced with '*' and the penultimate string token is also replaced with '*' .
 If the address cannot be tokenised into multiple strings all the charactors are replaced with '*'

 Anonymise dates : The date columns will be changed randomly by adding a random anomaly to the dates. 
 This functionality is not called by default as date_of_birth need not have to be masked as per the requirement . Just the function is given.

 The output is saved as in ./fake_data/anonymised_data.csv. 



How to run this application ?
===============================
NOTE : replace <useraccount>  with your account in the following steps

step 1: extract latitude.zip in any folder (say c:/users/<useraccount>)
step 2: ensure that your files are extracted   ( i.e  c:/users/<useraccount>/latitude )
step 3: run the following command 
         python.exe c:/users/<useraccount>/latitude/customer/start.py


How to run the testcases?
============================
Unit test are available in the   ...latitude/customer/test_cases/test_fake_data_generator.py
These pytests can be executed as follows 

step 1: Go to the project folder (i.e:  c:/users/<useraccount>/latitude )
            pytest -v


How to run this application with docker ?
===============================

Step 1: Go to project folder and create a docker image
Step 2: Run the command 
                     docker build -t fakedatagenerator:1 .
        This will create a docker image 
Step 3: Ensure that the image is created
Step 4: get inside the container by following the command below
        docker run -it fakedatagenerator:1 /bin/bash
Step 5: Run the command 
		python ./customer/start.py
Step 6: Now you can check the files with your editor of choice

Note : You can install the editor with the following commands in container shell 
            apt-get update
	        apt-get install vim
